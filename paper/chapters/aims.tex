De novo molecular structure prediction from \ac{MS/MS} research is still at a very early stage.
A few attempts were made to adopt the already more established research from the Natural Language Processing field regarding the use of deep generative models for text prediction, to predict SMILES.
Many decisions made to the model architecture were made by copying earlier research on large language models.
Because we are working in a different research domain, and the textual molecular representations have entirely different properties compared to natural language,
many of these decisions could be questioned.
Only now that a standardized dataset and benchmark (MassSpecGym) was released, it is possible to optimize these models.
The aim of this thesis is not to train the best de novo molecular structure predicting model,
only to benchmark the currently most used methods in the domain.
This way, further research can adopt these findings and steer away from the standards of the natural language processing field.
