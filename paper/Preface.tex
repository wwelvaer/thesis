The research for this thesis was a truly enriching experience, made especially enjoyable by the independence I was given.

I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Willem Waegeman, for his insightful feedback and the freedom he gave me to pursue my own research interests.

Special thanks go to Gaetan De Waele for closely guiding me through the research process while still allowing me to focus on my own interests. Our weekly meetings kept me motivated and sparked my interest in further research.

Finally, I'd like to thank Ghent University for providing access to its HPC clusters.
